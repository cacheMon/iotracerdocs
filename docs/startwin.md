## Basic Usage

### Program starts running 
Once started, you’ll be prompted to several options.

|:---|---|
| Anonymous | if you want to hide some [potentially sensitive data](./privacy.md). |
| Enable Automatic Upload | if you want the trace to automatically upload to our infrastructure. |
| Start on startup | if you want the program to automatically run every boot |

If you're comfortable with your choice, hit the run button.

### Exiting the program
Click the **Exit option** from the tray icon. A **dialog will appear** asking you to wait while the program performs cleanup. When the dialog closes, the program has shut down cleanly.

If you close the program properly, results will be saved inside the `output` path you have set!
