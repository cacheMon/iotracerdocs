## Update

The program will **automatically** detect update if there is any.

We allow user to manually check whether is there are any updates available through the tray icon

Updating process will require the tool to restarts. Hence, collection process will be stopped.

⚠️ **Important:**  
It's better for us to close the program if you want to shut your device. We'd like to prevent corruption happening during the data collection process 😉.
